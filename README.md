EA Software Engineering Virtual Experience (via Forage)

This project simulates the workflow of a software engineer at Electronic Arts (EA), focusing on designing and improving gameplay systems in C++.

🧩 Project Overview

As part of the virtual experience, I completed multiple tasks that mirrored real-world game development workflows:

Designed UML class diagrams to model an in-game “Momentum Meter” feature and its object relationships.

Developed C++ class headers defining attributes, behaviours, and interactions between objects.

Debugged and optimized an inventory system, fixing a logical error where items with zero quantity were not fully removed.

Practiced applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles — encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction — in a practical gaming context.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: C++

Concepts: Object-Oriented Design, UML Modelling, Debugging, Software Architecture

Tools: Forage, Visual Studio Code

💡 Key Takeaways

Strengthened understanding of C++ memory management and data structures.

Practiced systematic debugging and clean code conventions.

Gained insight into how game studios design, document, and maintain gameplay systems.
